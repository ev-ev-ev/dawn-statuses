Talent: Bladed Arm: When moving you ignore enemies and gain [Partner\u2019s Talent] Evasion if you moved through at least one enemy. Spirit: Ranged Arm: Your Finishers can target characters up to [Partner\u2019s Spirit] spaces away, when they target one character at that range exactly they also deal [Your Spirit] additional damage.
